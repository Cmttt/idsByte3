	<h2>Is the data complete?</h2>
	<p>The data is not complete because the phone only sends data to the database periodically. It does not track where the person is at all times. Therefore, it is difficult to determine if there are places that should have been logged but were not actually sent to the database.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="page-header">
	<h2>Is the data coherent?</h2>
	<p>The data does make sense compared to my expectations. The data shows that I was mainly at four different places throughout the week: home, gates, university center, and my friends apartment at Skyvue in Oakland. From my recollection, these are definitely the places I have been at the most. Also, the data shows that I regularly walk between the four different places, which is also in line with my expectations.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="page-header">
	<h2>Is the data correct?</h2>
	<p>The data also shows that I have been to the theatres as well as the supermarket. The dates however don't seem to co-incide with my expectations. For example, I went to the movies on the 24th, but it shows that I was at waterfront on the 25th. This could possibly be because my phone logged my location after 12 o clock midnight after the movie. I am surprised it did not log when I arrived at waterfront on the 24th. There must be some discrepancies in when the data was logged and when it was actually sent to the database.</p>
